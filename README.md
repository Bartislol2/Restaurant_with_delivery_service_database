# Restaurant_with_delivery_service_database
Project for Databases course at Military University of Technology
# Description
The model represents the potential operation of a restaurant chain offering
delivery to the customer. It makes it possible to track revenue on a
one day, evaluating the orders placed by customers,
monitoring the number of completed orders by each
employee, and the amount of sales of each product on the menu. The customer
can place an order at the restaurant itself, in which case there is no
information about their address, phone number, and name, or at the delivery service, in which they provide the aforementioned
data. Each customer is distinguished by a unique customer id. When an order is placed, 1 or 2 people are involved with it (on site - the
cook, on delivery - cook and delivery person). Each employee has
an assigned role for their order. The restaurant has a
a certain daily maintenance cost. You can pay for your order
by card or also by cash. Each customer can rate the order they have placed.
